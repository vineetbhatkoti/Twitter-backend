3)  POST /user/startFollowing  [QueryParam: firstUserId, secondUserId]
	Endpoint for start following other users as identified by firstUserId 

4) 	POST /user/unfollow    [QueryParam: firstUserId, secondUserId]
 	Endpoint to unfollow a user as identified by firstUserId

Extra Features:

1) GET /user/mostPopularFollower 	
   Endpoint to get all the users along with the most popular follower. The most popular follower is identified by the number of followers they have. 
   In this implementation a user can have one or more popular follower based on the number of people following them. 
   
   Eg. userId 9 is followed by userId 1,8,5,6.
   The number of followers userId 1,8,5,6 have are 6,6,2,1.
   Therefore for userId 9, userId 1 and 8 would be the most popular followers as they both have 6 followers respectively.
