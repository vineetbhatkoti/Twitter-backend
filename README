Twitter Backend Messaging Service
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This Spring based project has the following functionality implemented in form of REST API:

All the REST APIs are secured by basic authentication

1)  GET  /user/followers    [QueryParam: userId]
	The list of followers of the user
	
2)  GET  /user/follows      [QueryParam: userId]
    The list of people the user is following
    
3)  POST /user/startFollowing  [QueryParam: firstUserId, secondUserId]
	Endpoint for start following other users as identified by firstUserId 

4) 	POST /user/unfollow    [QueryParam: firstUserId, secondUserId]
 	Endpoint to unfollow a user as identified by firstUserId
 	
 5) GET /tweet/list        [QueryParam: userId, search (Optional)]
  	Endpoint to read all the tweets of a user and of that of the users they follow . Search param can be passed within the request to narrow down on keywords.
  	
  		
Extra Features:

1) GET /user/mostPopularFollower 	
   Endpoint to get all the users along with the most popular follower. The most popular follower is identified by the number of followers they have. 
   In this implementation a user can have one or more popular follower based on the number of people following them. 
   
   Eg. userId 9 is followed by userId 1,8,5,6.
   The number of followers userId 1,8,5,6 have are 6,6,2,1.
   Therefore for userId 9, userId 1 and 8 would be the most popular followers as they both have 6 followers each respectively. Hence, in the output user 9 would have 1 and 8 as most popular follower.  	
 
         	    
 Testing:
 Junit testing has been add to test the REST API end points. Extra gradle dependency for spring-security-test was added to mock the basic authentication for the API.
 Test classes can be found in com.thousandeyes.test. Each of the test class can be run as "Junit test case".

 Considerations/Assumptions:
 
 Basic Authentication:
 Since the users did not have any username and password associated with them hence for simplicity a user with "username: user" and "password: pass" was used to authenticate the API. 
 To extend the project we can have a complete user table which would have the user information along with the password then we can verify the credentials received from Basic Auth,
 against those in the database.
